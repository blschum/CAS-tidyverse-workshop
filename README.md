## Getting started
If you are participating in the workshop, you may either (a) work on the [tidyverse-workshop-TEMPLATE.Rmd], which leaves space for participants to type code with instruction, or (b) follow along along in the [tidyverse-workshop-KEY.Rmd], which has all of the information and code we will be working with. Download the [tidyverse-workshop-KEY.html] for a knitted (and much easier to read) version of the KEY.

## Outline
1. What is the tidyverse?
2. Useful functions to know for data wrangling, subsetting, manipulating, and summarising data
3. Wrangling and plotting data

## Data source
Gapminder.
