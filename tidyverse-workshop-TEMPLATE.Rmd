*FIRST*: Many thanks to An Bui & Sam Csik's `tidyverse` [tutorial](https://github.com/samanthacsik/Intro-to-the-Tidyverse), Dr. Simona Picardi's tidyverse [chapter](https://ecorepsci.github.io/reproducible-science/tidyverse.html), & Dr. Alison Horst's tidyverse [aRt](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) which helped immensely in preparing this document.

# Data Wrangling with the `tidyverse`

### What is the `tidyverse`?

The `tidyverse` is the bread and butter of data tidying, cleaning, organizing, manipulating, etc. It's a toolkit designed for [data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html). All of the packages contained within the `tidyverse` share an underlying philosophy, grammar, and data structure, making it easy to streamline data manipulation and visualization across multiple, unrelated datasets. Read more about this incredible toolkit [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)!

The *core* `tidyverse` includes the following packages:

* `dplyr` for data manipulation;
    + **primary functions**: arrange(), filter(), group_by(), mutate(), select(), summarize()
* `tidyr` for transforming data to a tidy format;
    + **primary functions**: gather() spread()
*`readr` for reading in rectangular data (e.g., .csv);
    + **primary functions**: read_csv(), readRDS()
* `ggplot2` for plotting/graphics;
    + there is **SO MUCH** to cover, here; [this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) is a good place to start (Wickam & Grolemund 2017)
* `stringr` for manipulating character strings;
    + **primary functions**: str_detect(), str_count(), str_subset(), str_extract(), str_replace(), str_match(), str_split()
* `tibble` for re-engineered alternatives to data frames;
    + **primary functions**: as_tibble(), tibble()
* `purr` for functional programming;
    + **primary functions**: map()
* `forcats` for working with categorical variables;
    + **primary functions**: fct_reorder(), fct_infreq(), fct_relevel(), fct_lump()
* `magrittr` for sequential modification of a data frafme;
    + **primary functions**: %>%

These are all distinct packages, and must be installed and loaded separately, but again, share common grammar, syntax, and data structures. 

### Load the `tidyverse`
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Data wrangling cheat sheet:

Below are reproducible examples of commonly used tidyverse functions.

Let's first create some completely hypothetical data about the number of times we have each eaten at Paka over the past four years!

```{r}
# NOTE: this data is NOT tidy (i.e. in wide format, where each row represents three observations, not one)
paka_data <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~`2017`,   ~`2018`,   ~`2019`, ~`2020`, # R doesnt' love vars named as numbers, so wrap them in backquotes! 
  "Britta",       25,        20,        16,        27,   # or avoid the problem by beginning var names with characters 
  "Lusungu",        20,        15,        11,        12,   # (e.g. "year_2017")
  "King",   18,        17,        10,        8,
  "Philip",     19,        10,        14,        22,
  "Lawrence",     34,        15,        9,        17,
  "Chisomo",     21,        13,        14,        11
  )
```


It's a **REALLY** good habit to **ALWAYS** explore your data before starting to wrangle it; form this habit, now (you'll thank yourself down the line!):
```{r, eval = FALSE}

```


Before we do anything else, we'll first want to transform 'paka_data' into a [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) (long) format. [Tidy data](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) follows three general rules: 1) variables are in columns (THINK: YEAR, AGE, INCOME, etc.), 2) observations are in rows (THINK: COUNTY, RESPONDENT,), and 3) values are in cells (THINK: COUNT, USD$, CATEGORIES). Having tidy data allows us to use the same tools in similar ways for different datasets... which means we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we do analyses, but can translate code/knowledge about toolsets to perform similar tasks on different data. We can't do this with messy data.

**pivot_longer()** transforms data from untidy, wide, to long format (NOTE: this function updates `gather()`, which is no longer under active development)
```{r}

```


Conversely, you can transform 'tidy_paka' back to wide format. 

Most R functions prefer long format, tidy data, hence the "tidy" in `"tidy"verse()`, and long format data typically eases data processing, but there are cases where wide format data is preferred (e.g., visualizing data in tables for human comprehension): 

**`pivot_wider()`** transforms data from long to wide format (NOTE: this function updates `spread()`, which is no longer under active development)
```{r}
# let's convert our 'tidy_paka' data back to wide format using spread()

```


From here on, we'll be working with our **tidy data** i.e. **`tidy_paka`** to practice some useful wrangling functions. But first, an interlude about [wrangling](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf). 

[Data wrangling](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html) refers to the art of getting your data into R in a useful form for visualization and modeling. & it is *definitely* an art...and a science...and sometimes takes some brute force. It can be a LOT of work; a LOT of HARD work. But `tidyverse`  and our use of tidy datasets have made this work MUCH, MUCH more predictable and user-friendly.

### Subsetting data: 

**`select()`** selects columns to retain and specifies their order in the data.frame()
```{r}

```


**`filter()`** selects observations within columns given some criteria
```{r}
# "|" tells R to filter any observations that match "Britta" OR "King"

# another way of filtering; this is nice if you want to filter through many unique column attributes

# != tells R to filter any observations that DO NOT match "Britta"
```


**`pull()`** pulls out a single variable from a data frame and saves it as a vector
```{r}

```

### Manipulating/adding variables:


**`arrange()`** orders observations as specified (*default* = alphabetical or ascending)
```{r}

```


**`rename()`** renames a column
```{r}

```


**`mutate()`** is SUPER versatile function; it can be used to calculate a new value using existing observations and place this value in a new column, it can be used to add a column based on existing observations, to coerce a variable to a different type, etc. Below are a few examples of its usefulness!
```{r}
# use mutate() to calculate a new value using existing observations and add this new value to a new column

# use mutate in conjunction with case_when to add a column based off existing observations

# use mutate in conjunction with ifelse, where if the observation in the 'name' column matches "Britta", "King", or "Philip", report "yes", they are soda drinkers If not, report "no", they are not

# use mutate() to coerce a variable to a different data type

```

### Summarizing data: 


**`group_by()`** groups observations such that data operations are performed at the level of the group; this is SUPER useful if you want to complete analyses by age class, or roof type, for instance.
```{r}

```


**`summarize()`** calculates summary statistics; this is also SUPER useful. Wanna find the mean? Median? Mode? Minimum? Maximum? Standard deviation? summarize() has your back!
```{r}

```


**`tally()`** sums values across groups; use this function to find 'n'
```{r}

```


# Now let's practice on some REAL*ish* data!

### Load the tidyverse and any additional required packages:
```{r}
g <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

### Explore: 

We should first familiarize ourselves with the data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

### Wrangle:

This dataset is **pretty big**--we'll want to wrangle it so that it only includes the information that we're interested in. We will:

a. filter for the African continent
b. select relevant columns of data 
c. rename columns  
d. create new columns.

To demonstrate these individual steps, we'll perform each function separately. Notice that we perform subsequent function calls on the data frame generated from the prior step. At the end, we'll show you how to combine all steps into a single, succinct code chunk. Creating efficient workflows by combining multiple data wrangling steps is one of the great POWERS of `tidyverse`!

#### a. filter for the African continent

```{r}

```

#### b. select the columns we want

Let's select only the columns we're interested in.

```{r}

```

#### c. rename columns

To make this even more manageable, we can change column names to something easier (i.e., shorter to type). For example:

```{r}

```

#### d. create new columns

We can also create new columns:

1) based conditionally on other columns; OR,
2) by preforming some calculation. 

```{r}
# conditional column addition


# preform some operation/calculation

```

#### Now let's pull all of these steps together!

We split each wrangling step up into a separate data frame, but you could have linked all these functions together in one chunk using the pipe operator, like this:

```{r}


# save data

```
